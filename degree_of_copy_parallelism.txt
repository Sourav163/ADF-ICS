## 🔀 **Degree of Copy Parallelism** in **Azure Data Factory**

---

### 🔹 **What is it?**

> This setting controls **how many data partitions/files/objects ADF processes in parallel** during a **Copy Data activity**.

It’s like saying:

> “How many pieces of data can I copy at the **same time**?”

---

### 🧠 **When does it matter?**

* When you're copying:

  * Multiple **files** from a folder
  * Multiple **tables** from a database
  * Partitioned data (like in Data Lake or SQL)

This setting **boosts performance** through **parallel processing**.

---

### ⚙️ **How it works:**

* ADF automatically splits the data source into partitions or chunks.
* **Degree of copy parallelism** defines how many of those partitions can be processed **in parallel**.

✅ Example:

* You’re copying **20 CSV files** from Blob.
* **Degree of parallelism = 5** → ADF copies 5 files **simultaneously**, then the next 5, and so on.

### 🎯 When to tune it:

| Situation                                                    | Recommendation                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Source/target supports high concurrency (e.g., Blob, SQL DW) | 🔼 Increase it                   |
| Source/target is slow, fragile, or rate-limited              | 🔽 Lower it                      |
| Files are small and many                                     | 🔼 Increase to reduce total time |
| You get throttling or errors                                 | 🔽 Reduce parallelism            |

---

### 📌 Where to configure:

* **Copy Activity → Source tab → Additional Settings**
* Field: **Degree of copy parallelism** (default: 4 or auto)

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

* Too high = may cause:

  * Source system overload
  * Throttling
  * Pipeline failure
* Combine with **"Max concurrent connections"** to fine-tune behavior

### 🧾 Summary:

| Setting                    | What It Does                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Degree of copy parallelism | How many partitions/files to copy at once |
| Higher value               | Faster, but riskier for fragile systems   |
| Lower value                | Safer, but slower                         |
