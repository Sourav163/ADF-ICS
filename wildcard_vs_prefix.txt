This confusion often arises because both **Wildcard file path** and **Prefix** in Azure Data Factory (ADF) appear to serve similar purposes‚Äîfiltering files from a folder. However, they serve different use cases and behave differently.

---

### üîπ 1. **Wildcard File Path**

* **Purpose**: Match files using wildcards (`*`, `?`) like traditional pattern matching.
* **File Path Type**: Set to `Wildcard file path`
* **Format**:

  * `folder/subfolder/*.csv` ‚Äî Matches all `.csv` files
  * `folder/data2024??.json` ‚Äî Matches files like `data202401.json`, `data202402.json`
* **Supports complex filtering logic** using wildcards.

‚úÖ **Use Case**:

> You want to load all files that match a certain pattern (e.g., `sales_*.csv`) within a folder.

---

### üîπ 2. **Prefix**

* **Purpose**: Load **all files starting with a specific prefix**.
* **File Path Type**: Set to `Prefix`
* **Format**:

  * `invoice_` ‚Üí loads `invoice_Jan.csv`, `invoice_Feb.csv`
* **Internally performs string-based filtering**, not pattern-based matching like wildcards.

‚úÖ **Use Case**:

> You only want to load files that start with a fixed string prefix like `daily_`, `errorlog_`, etc.

### üîÑ Key Differences

| Feature                  | Wildcard File Path       | Prefix                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Matching Style           | Pattern (e.g., `*`, `?`) | StartsWith (simple string) |
| Flexibility              | High (complex patterns)  | Low (only startsWith)      |
| File Path Type Option    | `Wildcard file path`     | `Prefix`                   |
| Example                  | `sales_*.csv`            | `sales_`                   |
| File extension filtering | Yes                      | Only if part of prefix     |

### üß† Why Microsoft includes both?

* **Wildcard** is for more **dynamic and advanced file selection.**
* **Prefix** is useful in cases where **you want simplicity and performance.**
  It can be **faster** in certain storage types (like Azure Blob) as it's optimized for prefix-based listing.

### üîç Real-world Example:

Say you have this in your blob:

```
report_202401.csv
report_202402.csv
report_backup_202401.csv
summary_202401.csv
```

| You Want To Load                     | Use Prefix           | Use Wildcard File Path |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Only files starting with `report_`   | ‚úÖ Prefix = `report_` | ‚úÖ `report_*.csv`       |
| Only files with `backup` in the name | ‚ùå Not possible       | ‚úÖ `*backup*.csv`       |
| Only `.csv` files                    | ‚ùå                    | ‚úÖ `*.csv`              |
