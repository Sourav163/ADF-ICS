### üîó **Max Concurrent Connections** in **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**

---

### üß† **What it means:**

This setting controls **how many simultaneous connections** ADF can make **to a data store** (source or sink) **during a copy activity**.

---

### üìå Where it's found:

In the **source or sink tab** of a **Copy Data activity** under "Additional Settings."

---

### üîß Purpose:

> It limits or increases **parallelism** when transferring multiple files, partitions, or tables.

---

### üí° Example:

Suppose you're copying **100 CSV files** from Blob storage:

* If **Max Concurrent Connections = 5** ‚Üí only 5 files are copied **at the same time**
* The rest are queued and processed in **batches**

---

### ‚úÖ When to adjust:

| Situation                              | Suggested Setting                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| You want faster data copy (more speed) | Increase max concurrent connections      |
| Source/destination system has limits   | Lower it to avoid overload or throttling |
| Large data volume with many files      | Increase for better parallel performance |
| Source API has rate limits             | Lower it to respect API throttling       |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

* **Default value:** Usually **4**, but depends on integration runtime & connector
* **Too high a value** might cause **network issues or service throttling**
* Tune based on **source system capacity** and **network throughput**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Real Example:

Copying from Blob Storage:

```json
"maxConcurrentConnections": 8
```

This means ADF will copy up to 8 blobs **at once** using 8 parallel threads.
