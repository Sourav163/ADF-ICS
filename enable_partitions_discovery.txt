### 🧩 **Enable Partition Discovery**

This setting is used in **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** when reading data from **folder-based partitioned file structures**, especially in **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)** or **Azure Blob Storage**.

---

### 📌 **What does it mean?**

When **partition discovery is enabled**, ADF automatically:

* **Detects subfolders** that represent **partition columns** (like year, month, region, etc.)
* **Extracts those folder names** as part of the dataset columns

---

### 📁 Example:

Suppose your files are stored like this:

```
/raw/sales/year=2025/month=06/day=13/file.csv
```

If **Enable Partition Discovery** is ON:

* ADF reads `year=2025`, `month=06`, `day=13` as **columns** in the data
* You don’t have to manually map these

---

### 🔧 How to Enable It:

* In the dataset settings, check the **“Enable partition discovery”** checkbox
* Works with file formats like **Parquet, CSV, or JSON**

---

### ✅ Use Cases:

| Scenario                             | Benefit                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Folder names used as data dimensions | Automatically adds as columns     |
| Loading only specific partitions     | Can filter using partition values |
| Time-series data stored by folders   | No manual parsing of paths        |

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

* Works best with **folder structure = `col=value`**
* You must **check the option manually** in the dataset
* Columns are added **automatically** during source reading
