## 🧼 What happens when you click **Reset** in Mapping?

* ✅ **Source columns** → get cleared or refreshed
* ❌ **Sink columns** → stay as they are (unchanged)

---

## 🧠 Why only source is cleared?

Because:

1. **Source schema** is usually auto-detected — ADF can easily refresh it.
2. **Sink schema** is usually **manually defined** or **linked to a database table**, so:

   * ADF **doesn’t want to mess with it**.
   * You might have set up **custom expressions** or **data types** there.

---

## 🔒 ADF is being safe.

* It clears the source mapping so you can remap.
* But it **keeps the sink mapping** to avoid breaking anything important.
