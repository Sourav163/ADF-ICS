## ⚙️ **Maximum Data Integration Unit (DIU)**

---

### 🔹 **What is a Data Integration Unit (DIU)?**

A **Data Integration Unit (DIU)** is the **unit of compute power** used by Azure Data Factory’s **Azure Integration Runtime** during **Copy Data** or **Data Flow** activities.

Think of 1 DIU as a mix of:

* **CPU**
* **Memory**
* **Throughput/network capacity**

More DIUs = More power = Faster execution (up to a point)

---

### 🔺 **Maximum DIU Setting:**

This setting allows you to **limit the maximum amount of compute resources** ADF is allowed to use for that activity.

* You set a number (e.g., 4, 8, 16)
* ADF uses **auto-scaling**, starting from a baseline, up to the **maximum**

---

### 📌 Where is it used?

* **Copy Data Activity** → under "Performance settings"
* Applies when using **Azure Integration Runtime**
* Not relevant for **Self-hosted IR**

### 🧠 Why Set It?

| Use Case                        | Benefit                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large data volumes**          | Increase max DIUs (e.g., 16 or 32) for faster throughput |
| **Small/cheap jobs**            | Limit max DIUs (e.g., 2–4) to **reduce cost**            |
| **Network-intensive jobs**      | Tune DIUs to optimize network bandwidth usage            |
| **Multi-pipeline environments** | Prevent one job from using up all compute                |

---

### 📊 Example:

Let’s say you're copying 200 GB of data from Blob to Azure SQL.

* **Max DIU = 2** → slower copy, cheaper
* **Max DIU = 16** → faster copy, more cost
* ADF auto-scales **up to that max** depending on load

### 📝 Summary:

| Setting          | Description                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Maximum DIU**  | Upper limit of compute resources ADF can auto-scale to |
| **Higher value** | Faster performance, higher cost                        |
| **Lower value**  | Cost-efficient, slower                                 |
