Great batch! Let’s break down these **file path-related settings** in Azure Data Factory (ADF), particularly used in **datasets or source settings** (e.g., for Blob Storage, Data Lake, etc.).

---

### 📁 **File path type**

Specifies **how ADF should locate and read files** from the source location (e.g., Azure Blob, ADLS).

Common types:

1. **File path in dataset** – Static path defined inside the dataset.
2. **Prefix** – Reads all files that start with a specific text.
3. **Wildcard file path** – Matches files using wildcard patterns like `*.csv`, `2025*.json`, etc.
4. **List of files** – You provide an array of specific file names to process.

---

### 📂 **File path in dataset**

You define a **fixed or parameterized path** directly inside the dataset (container + folder + filename).

✅ Good for:

* Simple pipelines with fixed folder/file structure
* Parameterized paths based on pipeline variables

Example: `container/rawdata/2025/06/sales.csv`

---

### 🔠 **Prefix**

Reads **all files** that **start with a specific string** in their name.

Example:

* Prefix: `sales_2025_`
* Matches: `sales_2025_Jan.csv`, `sales_2025_Feb.csv`, etc.

✅ Good for:

* Picking up files uploaded daily/monthly using a naming convention
* Avoids hardcoding filenames

---

### 🌟 **Wildcard file path**

Use **wildcards** to match file names or paths dynamically.

Examples:

* `*.csv` → all CSV files
* `2025*.json` → JSON files starting with `2025`
* `*/data_*.csv` → files inside any subfolder

✅ Good for:

* Processing multiple files in one run
* Flexible folder/file patterns

---

### 🗃️ **List of files**

You provide a **manually defined array** of files or paths.

* Usually done dynamically by:

  * Using a **Get Metadata** activity
  * Feeding output into a **ForEach loop**

✅ Good for:

* Custom logic to select specific files
* Combining with filters or conditions

Example:

```json
[
  "sales_2025_Jan.csv",
  "sales_2025_Feb.csv"
]
```

### 🚀 Summary Table:

| Setting              | Purpose                                   | Good For                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| File path in dataset | Static or parameterized file path         | Fixed files or param-based logic           |
| Prefix               | Match files by name prefix                | Dynamic file selection by naming pattern   |
| Wildcard file path   | Use `*` or `?` to match multiple files    | Bulk file processing, dynamic input        |
| List of files        | Pass a list of files manually/dynamically | Fine-grained control with logic or filters |
