## üìâ **Disable Performance Metrics Analytics**

---

### üîπ **What is it?**

This is a **checkbox setting** (usually found in the **Copy Data activity**) that controls whether **detailed performance metrics** are **collected and logged** during pipeline execution.

---

### üß† **When enabled (default):**

* ADF collects runtime statistics like:

  * Number of rows read/written
  * Throughput (rows/sec or MB/sec)
  * Duration per source/sink
  * Partition stats

‚úÖ These metrics appear in:

* The **Monitoring tab**
* **Activity output JSON**
* **Azure Monitoring Logs (if integrated)**

---

### ‚ùå **When you check "Disable Performance Metrics Analytics":**

* ADF **does not collect detailed metrics** during execution.
* Output will show only **basic status info** (success/failure, time).

### ‚úÖ **Why/When to disable:**

| Scenario                               | Reason                                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-throughput, large-volume copy** | Disabling metrics can reduce **overhead** and slightly improve speed |
| **Sensitive environments**             | Avoiding logging of **row counts or schema info** for compliance     |
| **Troubleshooting minimal setup**      | Want to keep logs lightweight or avoid noisy metrics                 |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Note:

* You **won‚Äôt see row counts, size, partitions, or throughput** in the output if disabled
* Does **not affect data copy** ‚Äî only affects **logging/performance tracking**
* Applies **only to that activity**, not the whole pipeline

### üîÅ Summary:

| Option                  | Metrics Collected?   | Use When                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå **Disabled**          | No (basic logs only) | Optimize performance, reduce logging         |
| ‚úÖ **Enabled** (default) | Yes (detailed logs)  | For monitoring, auditing, performance tuning |
