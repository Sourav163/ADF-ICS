## 🔁 **Copy Behavior** in Azure Data Factory (ADF)

---

### 🔹 **What is it?**

> The **Copy Behavior** setting defines **how the data is physically copied** from source to sink — specifically when writing to file-based sinks like **Blob Storage**, **ADLS**, or **file systems**.

It determines **what happens to file structures**, **file names**, and **data formats** during the copy process.

---

### ⚙️ **Available Copy Behavior Options (based on sink type):**

> (Exact options vary depending on your **sink connector** — here are the most common ones.)

---

### 1. 📝 **Preserve Hierarchy**

* Maintains the **original folder structure** from the source.
* Example:

  * Source: `/raw/2025/06/file1.csv`
  * Sink: `/processed/2025/06/file1.csv`

✅ Good for:

* Folder-based ingestion
* Partitioned data (year/month/day folders)

---

### 2. 📂 **Flatten Hierarchy**

* Ignores folder structure and **copies all files into a single sink folder**.
* Example:

  * Source: `/raw/2025/06/file1.csv`, `/raw/2025/07/file2.csv`
  * Sink: `/processed/file1.csv`, `/processed/file2.csv`

✅ Good for:

* Merging all files into one folder
* Simple archiving

---

### 3. 🔀 **Merge Files**

* Merges **multiple source files** into a **single output file** in the sink.
* Example:

  * Source: 100 `.csv` files → Sink: `merged.csv`

✅ Good for:

* Preparing consolidated files for reporting or downstream systems
* Exporting to tools that expect **single-file output**

⚠️ Available only for:

* File-based sources (Blob, ADLS, etc.)
* File-based sinks

---

### 4. 📎 **None**

* Just performs a **plain copy**, file-by-file, without modifying structure or merging.

### 🧾 Summary Table:

| Copy Behavior      | Description                             | Good For                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Preserve Hierarchy | Keeps folder path as-is                 | Partitioned or organized data |
| Flatten Hierarchy  | Drops all files into one folder         | Simplified outputs            |
| Merge Files        | Combines multiple source files into one | Reporting, archiving          |
| None               | Direct 1-to-1 copy                      | Simple file transfers         |

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

* Some behaviors only apply to **binary/text file sources**.
* Not supported in all connectors (e.g., databases or APIs).
* **Merge Files** can't be used when sink is partitioned or expects multiple outputs.
