## 🔒 **Bulk Insert Table Lock: Yes / No**

This setting appears when you're using **Bulk Insert** into SQL-based sinks like:

* **Azure SQL Database**
* **SQL Server**
* **Synapse SQL pool**

---

### 🔹 **What it does:**

Controls whether ADF will **lock the entire table** during the **bulk insert operation**.

---

### ✅ **Yes (Enable Table Lock)**

- ADF will place a **table-level lock**.
- ✅ Good for:

  - **High-speed bulk inserts**
  - **Large data loads** with minimal contention

- ⚠️ Downside:

  - **Other queries/transactions are blocked** from reading/writing to the table until the load is done

🧠 Think of it as:

```sql
BULK INSERT WITH (TABLOCK)
```

---

### ❌ **No (Do Not Lock Table)**

- ADF inserts rows without locking the whole table.
- ✅ Good for:

  - **Concurrent usage scenarios** (users/apps querying the same table)
  - Avoiding contention during business hours

- ⚠️ Slightly slower inserts, especially for large volumes

🧠 Think of it as:

```sql
BULK INSERT without TABLOCK option
```

### 🧾 Summary Table:

| Option  | Locks Table? | Performance | Suitable When                          |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Yes** | ✅ Yes       | 🔼 Faster   | After-hours bulk loads, staging tables |
| **No**  | ❌ No        | 🔽 Slower   | Table is actively queried or shared    |

---

### 💡 Best Practice:

- Use **Yes (table lock)** during **nightly ETL jobs**, when no other processes are reading from or writing to the target table.
- Use **No** for **incremental loads or live systems** to avoid locking issues.
