A **common source of confusion** in Azure Data Factory (ADF). Both **Degree of Copy Parallelism** and **Max Concurrent Connections** deal with **parallelism and throughput**, but they apply at **different levels** and **scopes** of data movement.

## 🔹 1. **Degree of Copy Parallelism**

### 💡 What It Is:

Specifies the **number of parallel threads ADF uses** to read/write data in the Copy Activity.

### 🛠 Example:

You have 100 files in blob storage and set:

* **Degree of Copy Parallelism = 10**
* ADF will process up to 10 files **in parallel threads**.

🔍 Applies to:

* File sources like Azure Blob, ADLS, Amazon S3, etc.
* Partitioned data in databases (e.g., PolyBase with Azure Synapse)

---

## 🔹 2. **Max Concurrent Connections**

### 💡 What It Is:

Limits the **number of concurrent open connections** to a data store (e.g., SQL DB, Blob, etc.) used by ADF during data transfer.

### 🛠 Example:

You set:

* **Max concurrent connections = 4** in your Azure SQL linked service.
* ADF will open at most **4 connections at a time** to the SQL server during the operation.

🔍 Applies to:

* SQL Server, Azure SQL, Oracle, and other database-based connectors
* Azure Blob, ADLS Gen2 (in some cases)

---

## 🎯 Key Insight:

> **Max Concurrent Connections** is about **network/database connection limits**.
> **Degree of Copy Parallelism** is about **how many parts/files are being copied in parallel** in one Copy Activity.

They **work together**, but adjusting them depends on where the bottleneck is:

* **Slow read/write speed?** Increase **degree of parallelism**
* **Connection timeouts or throttling?** Tune **max concurrent connections**

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy:

Imagine you're downloading files:

* **Max Concurrent Connections** = How many **browsers/tabs** you can open at once to start downloads
* **Degree of Copy Parallelism** = How many **downloads** can actively happen at the same time in each tab

---




---

### 🎯 Imagine You Are Copying 100 Files From One Folder to Another

Now think of two things:

---

### 🔹 **1. Degree of Copy Parallelism** = "How many files you can copy **at the same time**"

* Let’s say you set it to **5**.
* Then ADF will copy **5 files at once**, then the next 5, and so on.
* It's like having **5 workers** copying files at the same time.

➡️ **More parallelism = faster copy**, but only if your system can handle it.

---

### 🔹 **2. Max Concurrent Connections** = "How many doors (connections) you can open to talk to the storage/database"

* Let’s say you set it to **4**.
* Then ADF will use up to **4 connections** to talk to the source or destination.
* It’s like saying “You can have at most 4 communication lines open with the server.”

➡️ Too many connections can **overload the server** or hit **connection limits**.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Term                           | Think of it as...             | Controls...                                | Example                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Degree of Copy Parallelism** | How many files copied at once | **How many things ADF copies in parallel** | Set to 5 → 5 files copied at once         |
| **Max Concurrent Connections** | How many doors to source/sink | **How many connections ADF uses at once**  | Set to 4 → 4 connections to server at max |

---

### 🧠 Simple Analogy:

> You have 100 boxes to move.
>
> * **Degree of Copy Parallelism** = how many movers (people) are carrying boxes at once
> * **Max Concurrent Connections** = how many trucks you’re allowed to load at the same time

Both are important for performance — but they control **different things**.

---




---

### ⚙️ You Set:

* **Degree of Copy Parallelism = 5**
* **Max Concurrent Connections = 4**

Now, what happens?

---

### 💡 Important Difference:

These **two settings control different layers** of the operation.

---

## ✅ What Happens in This Scenario?

* **ADF will try to copy up to 5 files in parallel** (because of Degree of Copy Parallelism = 5).
* But it can only **open 4 connections at a time** to the source or sink (because of Max Concurrent Connections = 4).

👉 **So only 4 files will be copied at the same time**, not 5 — because ADF **runs into the connection limit**.

---

## 🔄 In Simple Terms:

> ADF wants to copy 5 files in parallel (based on your `parallelism` setting)
> But it hits a limit: **only 4 connections** allowed
> ✅ So it ends up copying **4 files at once**
> Then, when one finishes, another starts — still keeping the number of connections **within 4**

---

## 📊 Visual Example:

| File # | Will it start immediately?        |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| File 1 | ✅ Yes (Connection 1)              |
| File 2 | ✅ Yes (Connection 2)              |
| File 3 | ✅ Yes (Connection 3)              |
| File 4 | ✅ Yes (Connection 4)              |
| File 5 | ⏳ Waits (no connection available) |

➡️ Once File 1 finishes, **File 5 starts using that freed-up connection**.

---

## 🧠 Key Point:

> The **smaller value between these two settings becomes the limit**.

So in your case:

* `Degree of Copy Parallelism = 5`
* `Max Concurrent Connections = 4`
  👉 **Only 4 files are copied in parallel**, because **only 4 connections** are allowed.

---

### ✅ Best Practice:

To get full parallelism, **make sure `Max Concurrent Connections ≥ Degree of Copy Parallelism`**.




---

### ⚙️ Settings:

* **Degree of Copy Parallelism = 5**
* **Max Concurrent Connections = 7**

---

## ✅ What Happens Now?

* ADF is allowed to use **up to 7 simultaneous connections** to your source or sink.
* But the **Copy Activity will still only run 5 threads in parallel** (because **parallelism = 5**).

So:

> ✅ **ADF will copy 5 files at a time.**
> 🛑 The extra 2 connections (from the 7 allowed) will remain **unused** — because the activity is **limited to 5 parallel copies**.

---

## 🔁 Visual Flow:

| File # | Started Immediately? | Connection Used |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| File 1 | ✅ Yes                | Connection 1    |
| File 2 | ✅ Yes                | Connection 2    |
| File 3 | ✅ Yes                | Connection 3    |
| File 4 | ✅ Yes                | Connection 4    |
| File 5 | ✅ Yes                | Connection 5    |
| File 6 | ⏳ Waits              | –               |
| File 7 | ⏳ Waits              | –               |

➡️ As soon as one file finishes, another will start using a **free connection** — keeping the total active threads at **5**.

---

## 🎯 Key Rule:

> The **Degree of Copy Parallelism is the actual engine of parallelism**.
> The **Max Concurrent Connections is just an upper safety limit**.

### So:

* **You can have more connections than needed** — that’s fine.
* **But if your `parallelism` is low, not all connections will be used.**

---

## 🔧 Best Practice:

| Scenario                             | What To Do                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Want to copy more files in parallel  | Increase **Degree of Copy Parallelism** |
| Getting "Too many connections" error | Reduce **Max Concurrent Connections**   |
| Want full speed?                     | Set **Max Connections ≥ Parallelism**   |
