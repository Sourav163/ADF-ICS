## 🧾 **Pre-copy Script** in **Azure Data Factory**

---

### 🔹 **What is it?**

The **Pre-copy script** is an **optional SQL statement** that runs **before the Copy Data activity starts** — **only for SQL-based sinks** like:

* **Azure SQL Database**
* **SQL Server**
* **Synapse Analytics**

---

### 🎯 **Purpose:**

To **prepare the destination (sink)** before loading new data.

---

### 🔧 **What can you do with it?**

✅ Common use cases:

1. **Truncate the destination table**

   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE sales_staging;
   ```

2. **Delete specific rows**

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM sales_staging WHERE sale_date = '2025-06-13';
   ```

3. **Drop and recreate a temp table**

   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_load;
   CREATE TABLE temp_load (id INT, name NVARCHAR(50));
   ```

4. **Disable constraints/indexes** (for faster loads)

5. **Audit logging or pre-checks**

---

### 💡 Where is it configured?

Inside the **Sink tab** of a **Copy Data activity**, scroll to **"Pre-copy script"** and enter the SQL command.

> ADF will **run this SQL** using the **sink linked service** before copying any data.

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

* It must be a **valid SQL statement**
* It executes **once per copy activity**, before actual data movement
* Only available when the **sink is a database**, not files (Blob, ADLS, etc.)

---

### 🧠 Example Scenario:

> You want to load **daily sales data** to a **staging table**, but always clear the old data first.

**Pre-copy script**:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE staging_sales;
```

Then the copy activity writes fresh data into it.
