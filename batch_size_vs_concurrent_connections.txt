In **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, **Batch Size** and **Concurrent Connections** are both performance tuning options, but they affect data transfer in different ways and operate at different levels.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Batch Size**

### ðŸ’¡ Meaning:

**Batch Size** refers to **the number of records or rows read/written per batch** during a data movement or transformation operation.

* Mainly used in **Copy Activity**.
* Often relevant when **writing to a sink**, especially **SQL-based stores** (like Azure SQL, Synapse, etc.)
* Not always available for all source/sink types (depends on connector).

### ðŸ›  Example:

You set **Batch Size = 5000** while copying to Azure SQL DB:

* ADF will write 5,000 rows at a time in one commit (transaction).
* This reduces the number of round-trips, improving performance.

### âœ… Use Case:

Improve performance by sending more data per batch rather than row-by-row. Good when:

* Target supports bulk inserts
* You want fewer network trips
* You want to avoid overloading the sink

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Concurrent Connections (Parallel Copy)**

### ðŸ’¡ Meaning:

**Concurrent Connections** refers to **how many threads or parallel connections ADF can open simultaneously** to read/write data.

* Also called **"Degree of Copy Parallelism"**.
* Controls **how many files or partitions are processed in parallel.**
* Relevant for file-based sources like Blob, ADLS, S3, etc.

### ðŸ›  Example:

You have 100 CSV files in a folder and set **Concurrent Connections = 5**:

* ADF will process 5 files at a time.
* Once a file is done, it moves to the next one, maintaining a max of 5 concurrent threads.

### âœ… Use Case:

Increase throughput by enabling **parallelism**. Helpful when:

* Source folder has many files
* Source/sink supports parallel reads/writes
* You want faster processing

| Feature               | Batch Size                | Concurrent Connections              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Focus Area**        | Number of rows per batch  | Number of parallel threads/files    |
| **Applies To**        | Mostly databases          | Mostly file-based stores            |
| **Improves**          | Insert/update efficiency  | Parallelism and throughput          |
| **Unit**              | Row count                 | Thread count                        |
| **Controlled Where?** | Sink settings (e.g., SQL) | Source settings (e.g., Blob folder) |
| **Example**           | 10,000 rows per batch     | 10 files processed simultaneously   |

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Analogy:

> Imagine youâ€™re uploading data:

* **Batch size** = How many items you put in a single box.
* **Concurrent connections** = How many delivery trucks you send at once.
